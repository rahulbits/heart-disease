Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction

Jupyter notebooks and files used to generate the results and plots for the project :-

Jupyter notebook to read in the data, store it in a Pandas dataframe for initial processing and plots, and analyze with a logistic regression model.

Heart Disease prediction using 5 algorithms

- Logistic regression,
- Random forest,
- Naive Bayes,
- KNN(K Nearest Neighbors),
- Decision Tree

then improved accuracy by adjusting different aspect of algorithms.

Data Set Information:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
